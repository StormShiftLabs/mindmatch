Design a modern, full-featured dark mode web app UI for an AI-powered emotional journaling tool called MindMatch. This app helps users check in with how they’re feeling, analyze their mood using AI, receive a motivational quote, and track their emotional trends over time. It should look and feel like a polished, production-ready SaaS product you’d show to an employer.
🧱 Base Layout
The layout should be clean and intuitive with a responsive single-page dashboard structure, optimized for both desktop and mobile.
Use a rich dark background (#121212) with glowing, soft accents like teal, soft blue, or purple.
Design should include rounded corners, glassmorphism cards, and subtle animations or transitions for user interactions.
Use a professional but friendly typeface like Inter or Poppins, with great contrast for readability.
Include a fixed or sticky header with app branding: “MindMatch 🧘‍♀️”.
🔍 Feature Section 1: Mood Input & Analysis
A large text area input for users to write how they’re feeling today.

Once submitted, dynamically reveal a result section that displays:
Detected Mood (e.g., “😞 Anxious”, “😊 Happy”, “😠 Frustrated”)
Mood tag should be stylized with emoji and color-coded pill-style labels.
